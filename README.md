# Project Website

This repository jekyll-ized the source code for the [Nerfies website](https://nerfies.github.io).
You only need to change the content of [index.md](/index.md).
It's possible to only write in markdown, but you can also use HTML to achieve fancier effects.

Here is an [example website](https://shunzh.github.io/project_website/).
